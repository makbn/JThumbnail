# Contributing to This Project

First off — thanks for checking out this project.

While this is a small and focused library, and I'm not actively contributing, you're still welcome to open issues, suggest improvements, or fork it for your own use.

## Guidelines

If you do want to contribute, here are a few quick guidelines to follow to keep things clean and consistent:

### 1. Keep It Aligned with the Project Scope

This library is meant to stay minimal, maintainable, and aligned with its current goals. If you're adding something, ask:
- Does this keep the project simple?
- Does it make it easier to integrate JThumbnail into existing projects?
- Is it a core use case?

If you're not sure, open an issue first before writing code — happy to talk about it.

### 2. Code Style

Stick to standard Java conventions. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ, the default formatter should be fine. We also added spotless since v2.2.1. Some specific preferences:

- Keep every block of the code as small as possible, break it down if possible
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Avoid unnecessary documentation.
- Keep the code, variable/class/method/etc naming self explanatory
- Don’t go overboard creating tons of classes and interfaces just to perfectly follow a specific design or pattern—they're guidelines, not laws of nature.
- Prefer immutability where possible.
- Javadoc ,at least, public APIs.

### 3. Commit Messages

- Keep commit messages short and meaningful. 
- Avoid using any special characters. 
- Focus on delivering enough context than being grammatically correct. 

Thank you.
